# ValveIndex_FrunkFans
A very simple mess of geometry to probably house a fan or two.

Made to fit Noctua NF-A4x10 5V at least in theory.
Slightly exceedes the inclusion zone area. Pictured below

I've yet to print this myself, but according to Cura it should be quite fast when laid on the flat part on 'top' of the fan enclosure.

A lot of clean up, and padding, is expected to finish the printed model.
